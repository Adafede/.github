# Overview

This is the organizational page for the MITE (Minimum Information about a Tailoring Enzyme) data standard and affiliated work. 
The MITE standard summarizes experimental data on the reactions and substrate specificities of natural product-acting tailoring enzymes, and presents them in a machine-readable form.
For more information on the MITE data standard, see the preprint: <https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-78mtl>.
